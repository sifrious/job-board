# job-board

This is a draft of the README.md file for a jobs board project, a Laravel Inertia project running Vue components. I would not reccomend even reading this document, it's really not done.

## install

### ensure laravel and its dependencies are installed

ensure composer, npm, and Laravel Valet are installed on your machine. Clone the repository using
`git clone url@url` (don't do this now the app isn't finished) and navigate into the project with `cd nepajobs`

`composer install`

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

### set up `.env` file

create a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
generate app key? #todo

### use valet to

definitely add valet to your path
`valet park`
`valet link`
`valet secure nepajobs`
